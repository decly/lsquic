/* Our BBR implementation is copied from Chromium with some modifications.
 * Besides the obvious translation from C++ to C, differences are:
 *
 *  1. Instead of OnCongestionEvent(), the ACK information is processed at the
 *     same time as the ACK itself using cci_begin_ack(), cci_ack(), and
 *     cci_end_ack() methods.  This is done to fit with the flow in
 *     lsquic_send_ctl_got_ack().
 *
 *  2. The bandwidth sampler does not use a hash.  Instead, the sample
 *     information is attached directly to the packet via po_bwp_state.
 *
 * In this file and in lsquic_bbr.c, C++-style comments are those copied
 * verbatim from Chromium.  C-style comments are ours.
 *
 * Code is based on bbr_sender.cc 1a578a76c16abc942205a1a80584a288c262d03a in
 * the "quiche" repository.  (Not to be confused with Cloudflare's "quiche".)
 *
 * The BBR I-D is here:
 *  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cardwell-iccrg-bbr-congestion-control-00
 *
 * As for quiche, see
